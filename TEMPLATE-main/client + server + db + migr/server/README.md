This is the folder containing the server files for an application.

Here is what you should do to prepare it for use:
1. Read every README file to get to know the application and to learn the rules of creating clean code
2. Check out the example files if needed
3. Delete all README files and all EXAMPLE files
4. Go to the `.env` file and fill the missing fields. In most cases you shouldn't touch the fields that are already filled.
5. **IMPORTANT!** Go to the `.gitignore` file and uncomment the commented line. You don't want to be responsible for leaking company secrets!
